      subroutine balbak(nm,n,low,igh,scale,m,z)
!
      integer i,j,k,m,n,ii,nm,igh,low
      double precision scale(n),z(nm,m)
      double precision s
!
!     this subroutine is a translation of the algol procedure balbak,
!     num. math. 13, 293-304(1969) by parlett and reinsch.
!     handbook for auto. comp., vol.ii-linear algebra, 315-326(1971).
!
!     this subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a real general
!     matrix by back transforming those of the corresponding
!     balanced matrix determined by  balanc.
!
!     on input
!
!        nm must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
!          array parameters as declared in the calling program
!          dimension statement.
!
!        n is the order of the matrix.
!
!        low and igh are integers determined by  balanc.
!
!        scale contains information determining the permutations
!          and scaling factors used by  balanc.
!
!        m is the number of columns of z to be back transformed.
!
!        z contains the real and imaginary parts of the eigen-
!          vectors to be back transformed in its first m columns.
!
!     on output
!
!        z contains the real and imaginary parts of the
!          transformed eigenvectors in its first m columns.
