# FEANBEAM: Finite Element Analysis of Beams## DescriptionFEANBEAM is a fortran application that can be used to analyse beams and slender structures.Current features:* Geometrically nonlinear beam theory (Simo and Vu-Quoc)* Linear elastic material model* Initally straight elements* Quasi-static analysis* Newton-Raphson and Arc-Length solution algorithm## RequirementsTo compile and run FEANBEAM you need a fortran compiler. Here are provided scripts to automate this process written for Windows and Intel ifort compiler. L:ater GNU Fortran compiler will be added as well.## UsageApplication functions are written in modules which need to be compiled only the first time. For now the input is also a fortran file, which needs to be compiled every time it is changed. The goal is to completely separate the input from application. This will be done some time in the future.For now, there are two possibilities:1. Input using a script, where you specify everything. This is convinient for simple first attempts.2. Input using a script and support files, where you specify parameters in a separate file. This is more suitable for analysis that is run multiple times with slighlty tweaked parameters.Both examples can be seen in tests.## DependenciesFEANBEAM is in its core a self sustaining application and does not require many dependant libraries. That being said, there is one excpetion. Eispack is used as a solver for the system of linear equations. * eispack - http://www.netlib.org/eispack/All the required dependancies are included.## ContributionIf you like this project and think you can contribute, please do not hesitate to contact me.
