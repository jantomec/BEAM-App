      subroutine eltran(nm,n,low,igh,a,int,z)
!
      integer i,j,n,kl,mm,mp,nm,igh,low,mp1
      double precision a(nm,igh),z(nm,n)
      integer int(igh)
!
!     this subroutine is a translation of the algol procedure elmtrans,
!     num. math. 16, 181-204(1970) by peters and wilkinson.
!     handbook for auto. comp., vol.ii-linear algebra, 372-395(1971).
!
!     this subroutine accumulates the stabilized elementary
!     similarity transformations used in the reduction of a
!     real general matrix to upper hessenberg form by  elmhes.
!
!     on input
!
!        nm must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
!          array parameters as declared in the calling program
!          dimension statement.
!
!        n is the order of the matrix.
!
!        low and igh are integers determined by the balancing
!          subroutine  balanc.  if  balanc  has not been used,
!          set low=1, igh=n.
!
!        a contains the multipliers which were used in the
!          reduction by  elmhes  in its lower triangle
!          below the subdiagonal.
!
!        int contains information on the rows and columns
!          interchanged in the reduction by  elmhes.
!          only elements low through igh are used.
!
!     on output
!
!        z contains the transformation matrix produced in the
!          reduction by  elmhes.
